      '\n<p>As our society progresses, we need more electricity and energy consumption for the betterment of our lives.</p>\n<p>Over the years, as electricity dependency increases, we become ever more reliant on it for our daily lives as well as at home &ndash; air-conditioners, charging ports, computers, lights, as well as television and many other appliances such as smart home&nbsp;functions.</p>\n<p>In Singapore, it is important for you to engage a licensed electrician in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; it is required by law to do so. Check out <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg" class="external" rel="nofollow">EMA of Singapore</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n<p>Our general advice is that when it comes to electrical works, because it can become complex or be subjected to many human errors or accidents, we strongly advise you to engage or talk to a local qualified electrician&nbsp;for the work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19603 size-large" src="https://sghomeneeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/electrician-at-work-1-1024x615.jpg" alt="electrician at work" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://sghomeneeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/electrician-at-work-1-1024x615.jpg 1024w, https://sghomeneeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/electrician-at-work-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://sghomeneeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/electrician-at-work-1-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="electrician at work"></p>\n<p><a class="btn yellow" href="/professionals/electrical/electricians">Speak to a qualified electrician</a></p>\n<h2>Cost of Hiring Electricians (Electrician Rates)</h2>\n<p>Generally, there are 2 kinds of way for electricians to charge by:</p>\n<ul><li>Per hour (time)</li>\n<li>Per project</li>\n</ul><p>When hiring electricians, do take note that most of them charge a minimum fee for their visit.

Be sure to clarify in your call with electricians before hiring them to the site.</p>\n<p>Whilst professionals can give you an estimate, it may not necessarily be accurate all of the time. The best is to call up at least 2-3 electricians&nbsp;and ask them for their experience and pricing for <strong>each&nbsp;</strong><strong>project</strong>. There could always be other factors that can affect the cost of your electrical project (such as ERP fees, parking fees).

Some areas may also have building codes that you must abide by while conducting an electrical work.</p>\n<p>Violating such local regulations can lead you to fines and penalties and in some cases like damages and injuries due to your faulty electrical system may result in imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Remember that the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/NEC" class="external" rel="nofollow">National Electrical Code</a> changes every three years. So make sure you are hiring an electrician who is up to date with the code.</p>\n<h2>Why Should You Only Hire Professional Electricians?</h2>\n<p>You may have painted a wall in your room or may have fixed your gadget without any help. But when it comes to dealing with electric wires and connections, it is best to leave it to the pros.</p>\n<p>The electrical job calls for the expertise of trained electricians who are duly certified and licensed to practice. You should not trust people without proper certifications or licenses to do your job.</p>\n<p>Here are some compelling reasons why you should only rely on professional electricians when it comes to electrical work.</p>\n<h4>Safety</h4>\n<p>Doing the electricity-related repairs, installations, or maintenance with your limited knowledge of electrical work may lead your way to untoward accidents.</p>\n<p>However, professional electricians know the necessary steps and tests to perform before handling electrical wirings.</p>\n<p>In addition, they have the tools and protective gears required in their line of work. A qualified electrician can ensure that the installations or repairs made by him will not lead to any fire hazard to your home or building.</p>\n<h4>Cost</h4>\n<p>Of course, the cost matters when it comes to the electrical work. But hiring a cheap electrician can cost you double if you are not satisfied with the quality of work and need to hire another better electrician to fix the substandard job.</p>\n<p>A professional may charge a bit higher as their job carries some degree of inherent hazard. But you will get total satisfaction and value for your money.</p>\n<h4>Abide local regulations</h4>\n<p>Electrical work should be carried out or supervised by a Licensed Electricians.</p>\n<p>Whether you need installation, repair or modification of electrical wiring, you should always hire professional and licensed electricians to do the job.</p>\n<p>Engaging an unlicensed electrical worker may cause damage to property and pose safety risks and even penalties.</p>\n<h4>Quality work</h4>\n<p>Professional electricians go through several years of training, and they also need to pass certifications and licensing examinations before practising their profession.</p>\n<p>So hiring trained, experienced and licensed electricians will assure you that you don&rsquo;t have to bother about the quality and <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/Electrical_Safety.aspx" class="external" rel="nofollow">electrical safety</a>. Whatever repair or installation made by a professional will be working for a long time without any problem.</p>\n<h2>Checklist for choosing right electricians</h2>\n<ul><li>Verify licenses and insurances</li>\n<li>Do they provide a fair and competitive quote?</li>\n<li>Do they have enough experience in the field?</li>\n<li>Can they show you references?</li>\n<li>Do they have a professional attitude and apt qualifications?</li>\n<li>Do they offer upfront pricing?</li>\n<li>Are they able to complete your work on the set timeline?</li>\n<li>Conclusion</li>\n</ul><p>You must hire an electrician who is well equipped and qualified in every way.

Putting in a little bit of time initially will save you time and money in the long run.</p>\n<p><em>SGHomeNeeds aims to provide a guide of electrical job prices to the best of its ability, but does not guarantee each project to be within the prices stated in the guide.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please note some factors such as whether there are existing ports, whether there are existing materials (such as bulbs) provided by owners can affect project costs as well. </em></p>\n',
